0.0.39 (2016-01-28)
-------------------
* removing annoying print
* print warning when no route to node
* Impossible tests now require the navigation to fail on its own accord
  Currently, the impossible tests, i.e., blocking the way or the final node, require that the graceful death attempt is successful, meaning that the robot is able to navigate back to start after the navigation to end failed. With this PR, a new field for the service is added, giving feedback if the navigation timed out or if it failed on its own accord. Impossible tests are therefore only passed, if the navigation failed without timing out and if graceful death was successful.
* now execute policy server when it can't reach the position of the final node
* If the path or final waypoint is completely blocked the test will succeed if the robot is able to fail gracefully.

  This simply bulk replaces all ros_datacentre strings to mongodb_store strings inside files and also in file names.
  Needs `strands-project/ros_datacentre#76 <https://github.com/strands-project/ros_datacentre/issues/76>`_ to be merged first.
* bug fix
* Adding add Node controller
* Adapting Interactive Markers on Topological Map Manager to use the topological Map Publisher
  and bug fixes.
  *WARNING: Still requires a lot of testing*
* Topological navigation now uses topological map publisher
* adding topological map publisher and adapting localisation node to use it
* adding scripts to topological utils
* adding new visualization node to launch file
* Merge pull request `#69 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation/issues/69>`_ from BFALacerda/hydro-devel
  log of monitored nav events + improvements applied during g4s deployment
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation into hydro-devel
* Publishing edge move via goal feedback
* Adding Topological_map_manager
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation into hydro-devel
* Now action server returns cancelled when the target node is not found on the map
* outputting success imediately when source and target node are the same, when the action is not a "normal" navigtion action
* now it is possible to edit the influence zones from rviz
* fixing orientation reconfiguration for human aware navigation
* Adding machine tags to launch files
* now cancelling monitored navigation when top nav is preempted
* Fixing bug on topological navigation server preemption
* Minor bug fix Error Message should not appear any longer
* Not cancelling monitored navigation goal when topological navigation produces output on Node_to_IZ mode
* Adding Node_to_IZ
* printing available data too
* Added Warning when 0 or more than 1 waypoints match query for updating
* Small fix in topological map
* Now Topological Maps are stored in the topological_map collection
* Now is possible to move waypoints in Rviz using interactive marker and they will be updated on the ros_datacentre
* Making move_base care for orientation when next action is not move_base and Fixing bug when PREEMPTED
* Adding topological map python class and edges marker array for visualisation of the topological map in Rviz
* Fixing statistics bug
* Preempting topological navigation when monitored navigation is preempted
* Adding pointset to _meta information for Navigation statistics
* Merge pull request `#32 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation/issues/32>`_ from Jailander/hydro-devel
  Using Message store proxy to store statistics and Message Name Change
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation into hydro-devel
* Commit now vertex and Edge messages are capitalised, node message was moved to strands_navigation message
  Using Message store proxy to store statistics
* Added param broadcast for topological map name.
* Topological Navigation now works using message store proxy
* changing topic name
* Now publishes statistics over ros topic /TopologicalNavigation/Statistics and bug fixes
* Update package.xml
* Update CMakeLists.txt
* adding monitored navigation to topological navigation
